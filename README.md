# Introduction to Data Intensive Systems

This project aims to introduce developers to a large-scale distributed systems with more than 10TB of data from academia perspective. 


# Introduction

Because of the internet, cheaper storage and advanced in machine learning algorithm, many companies start looking for insight in their data to improve their bussiness strategy. But data size, nowadays, grow bigger and bigger requiring novel systems to handle. These systems usually are developed by big tech companies; Google, Amazon, MS, or Twitter. They introduced new techniques and well-designed architures which is very interesting and worth leaning.

I am just a newbie to this stuff but I want to note what I have leant to other developer that might interested in this topic. Most of them will be a review and short notes from papers.
